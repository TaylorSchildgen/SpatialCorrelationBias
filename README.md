Input files for Glide (linear inversion model) and Pecube (three-dimensional thermal-kinematic model) used to run synthetic tests reported in Schildgen et al., 2018, Nature.

The linear inversion model of Fox et al. (2014, ESurf) is available at https://zenodo.org/record/1215685. A description of the method is available here: https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/2/47/2014/.

When publishing or presenting results from the linear inversion (Glide) experiments please cite the following article(s):
